# Overview

Software development begins with a solid plan. Sometimes when you are working on a personal project, you can get away with skipping planning. However, when you are working on a collaborative project for a client, it is necessary to carefully define the requirements for the software and ensure you understand the software you are setting out to build.

## Objectives

- Define the requirements for a client's software project.
- Analysize the client's need and define the software requirments accordingly.
- Define users and their stories in order to understand requirments.
- Develop a system to track project process towards completing requirments.
