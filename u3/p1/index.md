# Overview

The goal of the project will be to create a Kanban board that will prioritize work towards meeting your software requirements. There are many tools available that are used online. Popular tools are GitHub projects, Trello, Jira, and Gitkraken Glo boards.

## Gitkraken Glo

We will be using [GitKraken Glo boards](https://www.gitkraken.com/glo) for our projects. You can read about [Glo boards vs. Trello](https://blog.axosoft.com/gitkraken-glo-boards-vs-trello/) for some advantages of this software over another popular tool.
