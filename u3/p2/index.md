# Overview

The goal of this project is to create the initial design for your user interface and the data model. These will likely change as you begin the development phase of the Agile software development lifecycle, but these documents will allow your team to have a starting point for conversations.

# Wireframes

A wireframe is a simplified layout for your userinterface. Think about applications you use every day. Are there any patterns that you can utilize to allow your user have an easier time working with your software? How will your user's needs be met physically by the interface?
