# Defining Users
Good software should always start with the user. You app or software can't be sucessful unless you are able to meet the needs of its user. There are many strategies for getting into the shoes of the user. We will use some of these techniques, but realize that the most important thing is understanding the user.

# User Personas
Personas let you get into the skin of your user. Being able to empathize with your user is critical as you begin to develop to meet their needs. Failure to understand your user will lead to failure of your software.
